Below are some of the user name to enter in the 
input section to get the repositories details

Usernames:

mojombo
defunkt
pjhyett
wycats
ezmobius
ivey

alternatively can use link: https://api.github.com/users to find users

I dont find any links for the tag sections so i have used the 
language details present in the repos content populates the tag section. Thus, the section
to get multiple section i cant get done.
